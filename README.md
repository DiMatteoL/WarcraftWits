# WoW Boss Memory Game
This project is a test to experiment with apps fully developped by AI. Don't juge the code quality on it (Or if you do, judge V0, N8N, Claude and
Cursor, not me).

## Overview
This project is an experimental application fully developed with AI assistance. It's a memory game where players try to name all bosses from World of Warcraft instances.

## AI Development
This project serves as a test case for AI-assisted development. The codebase was created using various AI tools including:
- V0
- N8N
- Claude
- Cursor

*Note: The code quality reflects the current capabilities of AI coding assistants rather than human-written code.*
